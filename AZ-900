Concepts :

1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
    - Make Your Own Pizza at Home
      You buy raw ingredients (dough, sauce, cheese) and kitchen tools (oven, rolling pin)
      You have full control over how to cook it — but you also have to do everything yourself: prepping, baking, cleaning, etc.
    - Example,
      Renting a virtual machine from AWS EC2. You decide the OS, software, and settings
      You also handle updates, security patches, and backups

    - You manage :
         Data, devices, accounts, applications, network controls, and operating system.
      Cloud provider manages :
         Physical servers, network hardware, and data centers


2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
    - Pizza Base Ready, You Add Toppings
      The pizza base is already baked for you; you just add your favorite toppings and bake it for a bit
      You don’t worry about making dough or cleaning the mess — that’s handled by someone else
    - Example,
      Azure App Service. You focus only on your app’s code
      While Azure handles the OS, server updates, and backups

    - You manage :
         Data, devices, accounts, and your specific applications
      Cloud provider manages :
         Operating system, infrastructure, and networking


3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
    - Order Pizza from a Restaurant
      You just order the pizza and eat it
      No cooking, no cleaning, no prep — everything is done for you
    - Example,
      Gmail, Dropbox, Office 365. You simply log in and use the service
      All the backend work is handled by the provider

    - You manage :
         Only your data, devices, and logins
      Cloud provider manages :
         Apps, OS, infrastructure, networking
