# IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
    - Make Your Own Pizza at Home
      You buy raw ingredients (dough, sauce, cheese) and kitchen tools (oven, rolling pin)
      You have full control over how to cook it — but you also have to do everything yourself: prepping, baking, cleaning, etc.
    - Example,
      Renting a virtual machine from AWS EC2. You decide the OS, software, and settings
      You also handle updates, security patches, and backups

    - You manage :
         Data, devices, accounts, applications, network controls, and operating system.
      Cloud provider manages :
         Physical servers, network hardware, and data centers


# PaaS (Platform as a Service)
    - Pizza Base Ready, You Add Toppings
      The pizza base is already baked for you; you just add your favorite toppings and bake it for a bit
      You don’t worry about making dough or cleaning the mess — that’s handled by someone else
    - Example,
      Azure App Service. You focus only on your app’s code
      While Azure handles the OS, server updates, and backups

    - You manage :
         Data, devices, accounts, and your specific applications
      Cloud provider manages :
         Operating system, infrastructure, and networking


# SaaS (Software as a Service)
    - Order Pizza from a Restaurant
      You just order the pizza and eat it
      No cooking, no cleaning, no prep — everything is done for you
    - Example,
      Gmail, Dropbox, Office 365. You simply log in and use the service
      All the backend work is handled by the provider

    - You manage :
         Only your data, devices, and logins
      Cloud provider manages :
         Apps, OS, infrastructure, networking


# Development Environment (Dev)
  - This is where developers write and test code

# UAT Environment (User Acceptance Testing)
  - After development and internal testing, the code goes here for business users/testers to check

# Production Environment (Prod)
  - This is the live environment — the real app that actual customers use


# Cloud Models :
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/5-define-cloud-models

# Private Cloud
  - Think of this as your own personal cloud. It's built just for one company or organization
  - It offers maximum control, privacy, and security—but it's also costlier and lacks some of the flexibility a public cloud offers
  - It might be hosted in your own data center or by a third party, but exclusively dedicated to your use
    - High capital investment (hardware, maintenance)
    - Full control, tailored security
    - Scaling takes time and investment
    - Example,
      A bank or government agency needing tight control over data and compliance. They host their cloud internally (or via a private service) to manage security themselves

# Public Cloud
  - This is like renting a room in a shared building—anyone can access it
  - Owned and managed by big providers like Microsoft, AWS, or Google, it offers fast setup, scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing, making it very flexible and cost-efficient
    - No big upfront cost; pay-as-you-go
    - Less control, shared resources
    - Very quick and easy to scale
    - Example,
      A startup launching an app quickly without investing in servers. They use Azure to get going fast and affordably

# Hybrid Cloud
  - As the name implies, it's a mix of both private and public clouds working together
  - You might store sensitive data in your private cloud, then use public cloud space to handle extra demand or scalability. It gives you the best of both worlds—control and flexibility
    - Mix: manage base costs privately, scale using public cloud when needed
    - Flexible control, choose where workloads run
    - Flexible—can burst into public cloud as needed
    - Example,
      An e-commerce business hosts sensitive customer data privately but relies on public cloud during high traffic events (like Black Friday) to handle the spike in demand

# Multi-cloud
  - This means using more than one cloud provider (like Azure + AWS + Google Cloud)
  - Maybe each cloud has different special features you want
  - Or maybe you started with one and are moving to another, so you temporarily use both

# Azure Arc
  - Azure Arc is a management tool from Microsoft, it helps you manage your systems whether they are :
    Only on Azure,
    On your company’s private datacenter,
    A hybrid mix of both,
    Or spread across multiple clouds (multi-cloud).
    In short, Arc makes it easier to control everything from one place

# Azure VMware Solution
  - Some companies already use VMware (a virtualization platform) in their own datacenters (private cloud)
    If they want to move to the cloud, they don’t need to throw away VMware
    Azure VMware Solution lets them run VMware inside Azure.
    This makes moving to Azure much smoother — they can keep using what they know, but with cloud scalability.
